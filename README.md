# RayTracer

Happy New Year!

This is a ray tracer project implemented using C++. This project is purely out of personal interest, and is still progressing. After basic functions have been implemented, I will start a new directory and move all files there.

Current Aim:
* Implement mirroring effects.

Current State:
